## Context and Problem Statement

The target users of our website are college students who are sensitive to budgets of making food. When users create recipes, we let them input an estimated total cost of all ingredients. We considered several forms of cost representations.

## Considered Options

1. Let users input an exact amount for estimated costs. For example, 17 dollars
2. Give users cost level options ranging from 1 to 3. For example, cost level 2

## Decision Outcome

We decide to use cost levels to represent the total cost of a recipe

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### [option 1]

Pros: Give recipe viewers a more precise sense of recipe costs

Cons: hard for recipe creators to estimate

### [option 2]

Pros: Simple for recipe creators to estimate costs

Cons: unable to give precise estimations for costs
