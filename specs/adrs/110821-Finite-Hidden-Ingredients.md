## Context and Problem Statement

We deliberated on whether the Create Recipe page should dynamically add new elements when a user wants to add an additional ingredient or step.

## Considered Options

1.  Create 10 hidden elements for the ingredients which are incrementally revealed after a user clicks an add button.
2.  Dynamically create new elements and add them to the page using javascript.

## Decision Outcome

We decided to dynamically create elements for ingredients and steps, but set up a finite upper limit of 25 ingredients and 10 steps.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### [option 1]

Pros: Simplicity and predictability. Less complex to implement.

Cons: Hard upper bound on the size of recipes.

### [option 2]

Pros: Allows for arbitrarily large recipes.

Cons: More difficult to implement. Could cause strange bugs.
